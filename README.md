Ecopoetry has a vital role to play in raising awareness about ecological issues, revealing the beauty of the natural world, celebrating the sacredness of life, and changing peopleâ€™s perceptions of the more-than-human world. Many of the issues that affect our planet are global in nature, and the Ecopoetikon project will encompass ecopoetry from both the Global South and the Global North.
Ecopoetikon aims to offer equal voice and representation to established ecopoets from around the world. Based in the Creative School at the University of Gloucestershire in the UK, Ecopoetikon is a developing research project that showcases a diverse international network of ecopoets through an online mapping project.
